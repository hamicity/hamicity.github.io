TikTok is the first Chinese application to ever [top the App Store charts in the US](https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/16/tiktok-tops-the-ios-app-store-in-q1-for-the-fifth-quarter-in-a-row/), and has since taken the world by storm with a fierceness that [continues](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/05/02/opinion/will-china-export-its-illiberal-innovation.html) to [terrify](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tiktok-cfius-exclusive/exclusive-u-s-opens-national-security-investigation-into-tiktok-sources-idUSKBN1XB4IL) confused Americans. Lots of journos continue to attribute TikTok’s rise to [“Sophisticated Chinese AI.”](https://www.fastcompany.com/90395898/is-tiktok-a-time-bomb) The contribution of "AI" to TikTok’s success is overblown compared to its innovation in remix culture (and, by proxy, meme culture). As far as I can tell, no one has talked about how oppressive copyright law, a very real hole we completely dug ourselves into, may have led to TikTok’s conception outside Silicon Valley.


### What’s different about TikTok?

Despite their differences, Western media coverage [*constantly*](https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/2/17644260/musically-rebrand-tiktok-bytedance-douyin) [compares](https://theoutline.com/post/6383/tiktok-will-never-replace-vine) [TikTok](https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/5/18009260/tiktok-musically-youtube-challenge-vine) [to Vine](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/09/30/how-tiktok-holds-our-attention), a short-form video sharing application which exploded in the early 2010s. Its [subsequent and sudden death](https://www.theverge.com/2016/10/28/13456208/why-vine-died-twitter-shutdown) honestly did feel a bit premature, as yet another apparent victim of the vicious Silicon-Valley hyper-growth cycle imploding on itself. Unsurprisingly, many people use the failures of short-lived short-video apps like Vine and Snapchat to predict the impending demise of TikTok. It’s easy to dismiss on-the-surface as “yet another trendy social media app,” but there are some core differences in philosophy between TikTok and other social media platforms that might give way to some interesting cultural analysis.

(I’m not exactly talking about the merits of the content on these platforms. There’s already plenty of critique and [discussion](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/29/style/ok-boomer.html) by [confused millenials](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/10/what-tiktok-is-cringey-and-thats-fine/573871/) about the actual content being produced on these platforms-- and predictably, just like anything else young people (especially young girls) like, everyone else tends to hate it.)

**What’s unique and interesting about TikTok is how creators are actively encouraged to remix others’ content.** Musical.ly, whose features and userbase was acquired by TikTok in 2017, made re-using and remixing existing video and audio as easy and accessible as possible. All the other popular social media platforms in the US are all focused on creating original content, or sharing others’ original content.

### Remix culture under an oppressive copyright regime

Remix culture is at the heart of Internet culture. Maybe the reason the vast majority of memes are image-and-text-based is that those things are harder to copyright, though [the corporations still try](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/10/nickelbacks-record-label-abuses-copyright-silence-political-speech). TikTok is the first platform that makes it easy to do this with multimedia content.

Meanwhile, in the US, we’ve created the most sophisticated vehicle for automated multimedia censorship to ever exist on the Internet: Youtube Content ID. (ugh of course in the US, we created this thing to protect the interests and money of massive media conglomerates; whereas in China, they implement network censorship to protect the interests and power of the state.) I mean, it’s ridiculous. Youtubers get their videos of TikTok videos [taken down](https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/17/18265484/tiktok-youtube-danny-gonzalez-kurtis-conner-react-commentary).

It’s completely unsurprising that TikTok came from a culture of [mountain bandits](https://www.bunniestudios.com/blog/?p=284) and not patent trolls. I’m not sure something like TikTok would ever have been conceived even by the most disruptive of Silicon Valley [frat boys](https://techcrunch.com/2014/05/28/confirmed-snapchats-evan-spiegel-is-kind-of-an-ass/) entrepeneurs-- at least, not under the US’s ridiculously draconian [digital copyright laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Millennium_Copyright_Act). 

Things are still changing. The app started in an environment with a culture of [virtually zero music copyright enforcement](https://ifpi.org/news/IFPI-releases-2018-music-consumer-insight-report), but China’s [starting to follow](https://www.scmp.com/tech/policy/article/2169623/chinas-copyright-watchdog-eyes-3000-websites-amid-latest-piracy) in the footsteps of the US. And since day 1 outside China, TikTok has been battling, and continues to battle a deluge of [copyright complaints](https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/digital-and-mobile/8533271/nmpa-tiktok-congress-investigate-copyright), mostly from the US, in order to win its right to exist.




<sup><sub>
**Addendum:** To clarify, I do like the idea of TikTok, but I’m still extremely against TikTok’s [opaque](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/sep/26/tiktoks-local-moderation-guidelines-ban-pro-lgbt-content) and [blatant](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/sep/25/revealed-how-tiktok-censors-videos-that-do-not-please-beijing) platform censorship practices. People are rightfully angry and loud about it. Since there’s already been a lot of backlash on this front, both by [other Big Boys](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-facebook-zuckerberg-tiktok/facebooks-zuckerberg-criticizes-tiktok-for-censoring-protesters-idUSKBN1WW2TG) and [government officials](https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/9/20906971/tiktok-censorship-china-bytedance-musically-marco-rubio-senate-mnuchin-cfius-treasury) seeking to regulate tech platforms, I decided not to focus on this angle. As an aside, here’s an interesting piece about how [Uyghurs are *evading* Chinese censors on TikTok](https://codastory.com/authoritarian-tech/tiktok-uyghur-china/).
