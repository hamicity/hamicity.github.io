## Who are we?

We're Hami, two individuals who like to think and write about stuff that lies at the intersection of languages, international affairs, and the Internet.

When we refer to ourselves, we speak collectively; that is, we are either referring to one of us, or both to varying degrees.

When referring to Hami, use they/them pronouns. In Arabic, it would be correct to use the dual, non-gendered هما.

## Why trust us?

We have academic or professional experience in community organizing, digital and network security, natural language processing, middle eastern history, network censorship, US-China tech policy, and philosophy of mind. We're somewhat-to-very fluent in Arabic (MSA and Levantine), English, French, Mandarin Chinese, and Turkish.

That's a lot of things! We often have interesting conversations at the intersection of our various experiences and we put some of these thoughts on the Internet.

## What is hami?

哈密 (hā mì) is the name of a delicious type of melon, like canteloupe, originally from its namesake city in eastern Xinjiang, in northwestern China. It's our favorite type of melon :)
